<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get set up locally. Don't hesitate to message me if you have any problems!

### Prerequisites

- [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- The [python installer package installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/): `pip` (used to install required dependencies)
```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:dave-cao/AudioMaker.git
```
3. Install pip packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Run the application
```sh
python3 main.py [YOUR PDF FILE]
```

2. If you run the application without any arguments, it will ask you for an input string. Type your text and enter. It will create a text-to-speech of your string!

```sh
python3 main.py
```

3. Exit application
```
ctl + c
```

_For a more comprehensive example of using this application, refer to this [video](https://youtu.be/T6GaHwNWMWA)_

## Roadmap

There are no future plans for this project. Perhaps instead of using Google's api for text to speech, I could try to learn the other open source text to speech servers.
